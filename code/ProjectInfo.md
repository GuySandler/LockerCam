This is my first hardware + software Project so for this to work you will need:
- raspberry pi 0 w (not now, I will anounce when)
- raspberry pi camara (same as top)

If you don't want to get these things and download the code along with connecting the codes and stuff you can order it from me when it's done (no shipping now)

There is NO website, it will probobly come out after I finish

The LockerCam uses dropbox to save the photos, to connect your account you must go to

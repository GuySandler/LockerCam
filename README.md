# LockerCam
This is the open-source code of the LockerCam

## About this project
My school has reacently been attacked by Tiktokers that like doing stuff like vandalizing and breaking into other's lockers

So I, decided to make a camera. From scratch. Other then googleing 80% of the code


if you are wondering yes, this is allowed (in California). You can't put cameras in a locker room (gym) or bathrooms, but if you put one in your locker it's fine because the person breaking in isn't suposed to be there.
